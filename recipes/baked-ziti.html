<h2>Description:</h2>
<p style="width: 500px">
  Ziti is a very popular tube shaped pasta. Ziti gets its name from the word
  zita, which means bride. In Naples, Ziti is the classic pasta served at
  weddings as the zita/bride's pasta. Ziti goes well with fresh, light sauces
  like olive oil or a simple fresh tomato sauce.
