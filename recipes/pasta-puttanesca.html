    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p style="width: 500px">
      Pasta puttanesca might have a slightly scandalous history, but we love it
      all the same. With an extremely fragrant sauce, this pasta is to die for.
      Bursting with flavor and so easy to prepare, you'll be craving this pasta
      every week. The super-fragrant sauce is made with a lot of garlic and
      anchovies that will have you addicted right away, and the capers and
      olives add a briny saltiness to the dish. It's definitely a break from the
      classic spaghetti and meatballs that feels a little more complicated even
      though it isn't. Serve it with the best garlic bread ever and call it a
      day.
