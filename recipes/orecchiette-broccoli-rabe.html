    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p style="width: 500px">
      Orecchiette, literally translating to "little ears" in Italian, is a
      crazy-underrated and underutilized pasta in the home kitchen. The tiny
      little indentations catch so much sauce! Here, the sauce is similar to
      that of cacio e pepe. You just need butter, pasta water, pepper, and
      cheese. Toasting the pepper in butter is key, folks. DO NOT skip it.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ol style="width: 500px">
      <li>
        In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta until al dente
        according to package directions. During the last 2 minutes, add broccoli
        rabe and cook 1 minute. Reserve 1 cup pasta water, then drain pasta and
        broccoli rabe together
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add sausage and cook,
        stirring occasionally, until warmed through and slightly golden, about 5
        minutes. Add 1 tablespoon butter and garlic and season generously with
        pepper. Cook until fragrant, 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add Â½ cup reserved pasta water and bring to a simmer. Add remaining 2
        tablespoons butter, broccoli rabe, and pasta and toss to combine
      </li>
      <li>
        Add Parmesan, lemon zest and juice, and red pepper flakes. Toss
        constantly to melt cheese, removing skillet from heat when about half
        the cheese has melted. If sauce is still too thick, loosen with more
        pasta water. Season with salt before serving.
